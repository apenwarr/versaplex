D-Bus for .NET
==============

This is a C# implementation of D-Bus. It's often referred to as "managed
D-Bus" to avoid confusion with existing bindings (which wrap libdbus).

See http://www.ndesk.org/DBusSharp

D-Bus is an inter-process communication framework that lets applications
interface with the system event bus as well as allowing them to talk to
one another in a peer-to-peer configuration.

See http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus for general
information on the D-Bus IPC mechanism.

This software is under active development but is already used by a wide
range of applications for tasks as simple as maintaining a single
instance of the GUI to whole instant messaging frameworks and hardware
detection APIs.

It provides a tested, high-performance bridge to and from all systems
that are exposed via D-Bus, regardless of programming language, UI
toolkit or license. The source code is MIT X11 licensed (Free
Software/Open Source), allowing integration into other projects with
very few restrictions.

The code was written and is maintained by Alp Toker <alp@atoker.com>

It is a clean-room implementation based on the D-Bus Specification
Version 0.11 and study of the wire protocol of existing tools.

It aims for compatibility with Mono and Microsoft .NET frameworks
supporting the 2.0 profile. Backward compatibility with 1.0 will not be
a consideration.
