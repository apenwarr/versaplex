NOTE!  You have to run this script as root, or sudo, whatever.  The reason
is that it invokes tcpdump which needs escalated privileges in order to
monitor your network interfaces.  There are ways around that, but I was too
lazy to bother implementing them. So, be root.

Run this script just as "./versabench.pl" (or sudo ./versabench.pl, probably).
for your own sanity, it's better to run with "./versabench.pl 2>/dev/null", or
vxodbc will hurt you.

You'll need tcpdump.  I hope that goes without having said... that.

Note: In order to connect to an MS SQL database, I had to install (under
Linux Ubuntu) the packages:
	freetds-dev
	libdbd-sybase-perl (as opposed to DBD::FreeTDS, which is unmaintained)

Add this to /etc/freetds/freetds.conf:
	[testdb]
		host = $IP_ADDRESS_OF_YOUR_SQL_SERVER
		port = 1433
		tds version = 8.0

Now this can connect to an SQL database!


For DBus purposes, you need:
	libnet-dbus-perl

Set the $dbus_moniker variable below to your DBus connection string, and off
you go.


To get VxODBC working right, you'll need:
	libdbd-odbc-perl
	unixodbc-dev

Now, this part is a little tricky.  You'll obviously need a VxODBC with its
supporting libraries; easiest way to do that is check out a copy of the
versaplex tree and compile it.

Add this to /etc/odbcinst.ini:
	[ODBC Drivers]
	VxODBC		= Installed

	[VxODBC]
	Description	= The biggest pair you've ever seen twinkleberry
	Driver		= $ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_VXODBC/vxodbc.so
	Setup		= $ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_VXODBC/vxodbc.so
	UsageCount	= 1

Add this to /etc/odbc.ini:
	[testdb]
	Driver = VxODBC
	Database = $desired_name_of_connection_in_your_versaplexd.ini
	Servername = do_i_do_anything
	Username = lkosewsk
	DBus = dbus:session

Done and done.  You can test that this works by running:
	export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=$vxodbc_dbus_moniker
	isql -v testdb $username $pw

Here, $vxodbc_dbus_moniker is the connection moniker to DBus, and
username and pw are the database username and password respectively.
Try some practice commands, and if they work, you're golden.

THEN: edit versabench.conf and modify the configuration variables to match
the ones you want to use.
