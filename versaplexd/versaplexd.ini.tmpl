[Connections]
; Maps connection names to the information needed to connect.
; For MS SQL servers, use dbname = mssql:MSSQL Connection String.  For example:
;
; testdb = mssql:User Id=sa;Password=mypass;Server=myserver;Initial Catalog=mydbname

[User Map]
; Maps user names to the database they're allowed to use.  For example:
;
; pmccurdy = testdb
; * = testdb

[Security Level]
; Maps a user to a particular security level.  Currently, only levels 0
; (totally unrestricted), 1 (allowed only a single non-select query), and 2
; (allowed only select queries) are supported.  2 is the default setting for
; every user.
; NOTE:  Setting a security setting for the user running unit tests to anything
; higher than 0 *will* cause unit test failures.
; NOTE2:  Setting user '*' to some value other than 2 means that any user not
; explicitly assigned a value will inherit that a permission level.  You've been
; warned.
;
; evil_pmccurdy = 2
; * = 0

[Cert Map]
; Maps a certificate fingerprint (get_fingerprint() in WvX509) to a username,
; usernames are given permissions based on the User Map.  For example:
;
; 85:DD:67:D3:ED:8F:39:58:E5:4A:E9:88:0D:22:C9:E5:70:41:71:75 = lkosewsk
